COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF COMPILER FIXES FOR RUST MCP TEMPLATE
================================================================

This document details all changes made to fix compiler errors in the Rust MCP template repository.
These changes ensure compatibility with rmcp SDK commit 3196c95f and schemars 1.0.

OVERVIEW OF ISSUES FIXED:
========================
1. Missing auth module declaration
2. Schemars version conflict (0.8 vs 1.0)
3. Deprecated rmcp::Error usage
4. Missing uuid dependency
5. Conditional compilation issues with auth feature
6. Unused imports cleanup

DETAILED CHANGES BY FILE:
========================

1. Cargo.toml
-------------
CHANGES:
- REMOVED: schemars = "0.8" from serialization dependencies
- ADDED: schemars = "1.0" to serialization dependencies  
- CHANGED: uuid dependency from optional to required
  FROM: uuid = { version = "1.0", features = ["v4", "serde"], optional = true }
  TO:   uuid = { version = "1.0", features = ["v4", "serde"] }
- UPDATED: auth feature dependencies
  FROM: auth = ["redis", "uuid", "zeroize", "chrono"]
  TO:   auth = ["redis", "zeroize", "chrono"]

REASONING: 
- schemars 1.0 required to match rmcp SDK dependency
- uuid made unconditional to avoid conditional compilation complexity
- Removed uuid from auth feature since it's now always available

2. src/lib.rs
-------------
CHANGES:
- ADDED: pub mod auth; (line 1, before other modules)
- UPDATED: Error import
  FROM: Error as McpError,
  TO:   ErrorData as McpError,
- REMOVED: schemars from rmcp imports
  FROM: schemars, tool, tool_handler, tool_router
  TO:   tool, tool_handler, tool_router
- REMOVED: wrapper::Json from imports
  FROM: use rmcp::handler::server::{router::tool::ToolRouter, tool::Parameters, wrapper::Json};
  TO:   use rmcp::handler::server::{router::tool::ToolRouter, tool::Parameters};

REASONING:
- auth module was missing causing import errors in other files
- rmcp::Error deprecated in favor of rmcp::ErrorData
- schemars should be imported directly, not through rmcp
- wrapper::Json was unused

3. src/auth.rs
--------------
CHANGES:
- REMOVED: Context import from anyhow
  FROM: use anyhow::{Context, Result};
  TO:   use anyhow::Result;
- UPDATED: OAuthTokenData conditional compilation
  FROM: #[cfg(feature = "auth")]
        #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Zeroize, ZeroizeOnDrop)]
  TO:   #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
        #[cfg_attr(feature = "auth", derive(zeroize::Zeroize, zeroize::ZeroizeOnDrop))]
- UPDATED: zeroize attributes to be conditional
  FROM: #[zeroize(skip)]
  TO:   #[cfg_attr(feature = "auth", zeroize(skip))]
- MOVED: OAuthTokenData impl outside feature gate
  FROM: #[cfg(feature = "auth")]
        impl OAuthTokenData {
  TO:   impl OAuthTokenData {
- UPDATED: is_expired() method with conditional compilation
  Added #[cfg(feature = "auth")] and #[cfg(not(feature = "auth"))] blocks
- SIMPLIFIED: feature imports
  FROM: #[cfg(feature = "auth")]
        use {
            zeroize::{Zeroize, ZeroizeOnDrop},
            redis::AsyncCommands,
        };
  TO:   #[cfg(feature = "auth")]
        use redis::AsyncCommands;
- UPDATED: Error types in non-auth implementations
  FROM: ServerError::InvalidSession
  TO:   ServerError::InvalidInput
  (Applied to resolve_session, get_oauth_token, authenticate, validate_session_format)

REASONING:
- OAuthTokenData needs to be available regardless of auth feature for type compatibility
- Conditional compilation ensures zeroize only used when auth feature enabled
- InvalidSession error variant only available with auth feature
- Context import was unused

4. src/tools/dice_example.rs
----------------------------
CHANGES:
- UPDATED: Error import
  FROM: use rmcp::{Error as McpError, model::{CallToolResult, Content}};
  TO:   use rmcp::{ErrorData as McpError, model::{CallToolResult, Content}};
- ADDED: schemars import
  FROM: use serde::Deserialize;
  TO:   use serde::Deserialize;
        use schemars::JsonSchema;
- UPDATED: JsonSchema derive
  FROM: #[derive(Debug, Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
  TO:   #[derive(Debug, Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
- ADDED: Documentation comments for schema
  FROM: #[schemars(description = "Number of sides on the dice (e.g. 6 for d6, 20 for d20)")]
        pub sides: u32,
        #[schemars(description = "Number of dice to roll")]
  TO:   /// Number of sides on the dice (e.g. 6 for d6, 20 for d20)
        pub sides: u32,
        /// Number of dice to roll

REASONING:
- rmcp::Error deprecated
- schemars 1.0 requires direct import
- Doc comments preferred over schemars attributes for descriptions

5. src/tools/session_example.rs
-------------------------------
CHANGES:
- UPDATED: Error import
  FROM: use rmcp::{Error as McpError, model::{CallToolResult, Content}, schemars::JsonSchema};
  TO:   use rmcp::{ErrorData as McpError, model::{CallToolResult, Content}};
- ADDED: schemars import
  ADDED: use schemars::JsonSchema;
- UPDATED: JsonSchema derives (2 structs)
  Both SessionInfoRequest and UserProfileRequest updated similarly to dice_example.rs
- CONVERTED: schemars attributes to doc comments
  FROM: #[schemars(description = "Session ID for authenticated user (UUID4 format)")]
  TO:   /// Session ID for authenticated user (UUID4 format)

REASONING: Same as dice_example.rs

6. src/tools/http_client_example.rs
----------------------------------
CHANGES:
- UPDATED: Error import (same as other tools)
- ADDED: schemars import
- UPDATED: JsonSchema derives (2 structs: AuthenticatedApiRequest, PublicApiRequest)
- CONVERTED: All schemars attributes to doc comments
  Examples:
  FROM: #[schemars(description = "Session ID for authenticated user (UUID4 format)")]
  TO:   /// Session ID for authenticated user (UUID4 format)
  FROM: #[schemars(description = "API endpoint URL to call")]
  TO:   /// API endpoint URL to call
  FROM: #[schemars(description = "OAuth provider for token (e.g., 'google', 'github')")]
  TO:   /// OAuth provider for token (e.g., 'google', 'github')
  FROM: #[schemars(description = "HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)")]
  TO:   /// HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  FROM: #[schemars(description = "Optional JSON body for POST/PUT requests")]
  TO:   /// Optional JSON body for POST/PUT requests

REASONING: Same as other tool files

VERIFICATION STEPS:
==================
After applying all changes:

1. cargo check - Should pass without errors
2. cargo build - Should compile successfully  
3. cargo test - All tests should pass

EXPECTED WARNINGS:
=================
- One unused variable warning in session_example.rs test (non-critical)
- No other warnings should appear

COMPATIBILITY NOTES:
===================
- These changes are compatible with rmcp SDK commit 3196c95f and later
- schemars 1.0 is required (matches rmcp dependency)
- uuid is now always available (not feature-gated)
- All auth-related functionality works with and without auth feature
- JsonSchema implementations use schemars 1.0 API

TEMPLATE UPDATE CHECKLIST:
==========================
□ Update Cargo.toml dependencies as specified
□ Add auth module declaration to lib.rs
□ Update all rmcp::Error to rmcp::ErrorData
□ Remove unused imports from lib.rs
□ Fix conditional compilation in auth.rs
□ Update all tool files with new schemars imports and doc comments
□ Test compilation with: cargo check && cargo build && cargo test

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
========================
1. schemars version MUST be 1.0 to match rmcp
2. uuid MUST be unconditional dependency
3. auth module MUST be declared in lib.rs
4. All rmcp::Error references MUST be updated to rmcp::ErrorData
5. JsonSchema derives MUST import schemars directly, not through rmcp

This comprehensive fix ensures the Rust MCP template compiles successfully and is ready for development.
